iRules bundle for F5 Networks BIG-IP syntax (http://devcentral.f5.com)

This was created from content found on DevCentral.

The command completion and syntax highlighting should be complete as of TMOS v11.2.

This bundle was updated on August 15, 2012 and is currently maintained by Bill Church (https://github.com/billchurch/iRules.tmbundle).

Any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to contact me.

The bulk of the TCL syntax highlighting was pulled from the TCL bundle by Kevin Ballard.

# Disclaimer
I'm no longer maintaining the bundle, see my sublime-iRules bundle instead (https://github.com/billchurch/sublime-iRules). This is hopefully out of date now.
